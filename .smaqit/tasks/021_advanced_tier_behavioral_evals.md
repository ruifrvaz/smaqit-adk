# Advanced-Tier Behavioral Evals

**Status:** Not Started  
**Created:** 2026-04-05

## Description

Rewrite and extend the behavioral eval suite for the advanced-tier artifacts. The existing 7 evals (`smaqit.new-agent`, `smaqit.new-skill`, `smaqit.L2`) were written before Task 018 (Level Skills Completion) and need to be reviewed, aligned, and extended to cover the new skills (`smaqit.new-principle`, `smaqit.new-template`, `smaqit.new-rules`) and updated L0/L1 agents.

## Scope

| Artifact | Type | Current eval coverage | Target coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smaqit.L2` agent | Level agent | 2 evals (compile, reject placeholders) | Review + retain or replace |
| `smaqit.new-agent` skill | Advanced skill | 3 evals | Review + retain or replace |
| `smaqit.new-skill` skill | Advanced skill | 2 evals | Review + retain or replace |
| `smaqit.L0` agent | Level agent | none | ≥1 eval (principle curation) |
| `smaqit.L1` agent | Level agent | none | ≥1 eval (template compilation) |
| `smaqit.new-principle` skill | Advanced skill | none | ≥2 evals |
| `smaqit.new-template` skill | Advanced skill | none | ≥1 eval |
| `smaqit.new-rules` skill | Advanced skill | none | ≥1 eval |

## Deliverables

- Review all 7 existing evals: update, retire, or retain each
- New eval files for `smaqit.L0`, `smaqit.L1`, `smaqit.new-principle`, `smaqit.new-template`, `smaqit.new-rules`
- All evals pass `make -C installer evals`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All 7 existing evals reviewed and confirmed current or replaced
- [ ] Eval files authored for `smaqit.L0` agent (≥1 eval)
- [ ] Eval files authored for `smaqit.L1` agent (≥1 eval)
- [ ] Eval files authored for `smaqit.new-principle` skill (≥2 evals)
- [ ] Eval files authored for `smaqit.new-template` skill (≥1 eval)
- [ ] Eval files authored for `smaqit.new-rules` skill (≥1 eval)
- [ ] All evals pass `make -C installer evals` (exit 0, no FAIL)

## Dependencies

- Task 018 (Level Skills Completion) — `smaqit.new-principle`, `smaqit.new-template`, `smaqit.new-rules` must exist before evals can be written for them
- Task 019 (Cross-Level Compilation) — optional; `smaqit.compile.*` skills can be covered in a follow-on eval task if needed

## Notes

- Existing evals live in `tests/evals/agents/smaqit.L2/` and `tests/evals/skills/smaqit.new-agent/` and `tests/evals/skills/smaqit.new-skill/`
- Review for staleness: the `smaqit.new-agent` evals simulate a full gathering flow that may have changed with Task 018
- Do not delete existing evals until their replacement is confirmed passing
- This task is blocked until Task 018 delivers stable L0/L1 artifact definitions
